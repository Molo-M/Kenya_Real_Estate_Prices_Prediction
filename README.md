# Kenya Real Estate Prices Prediction

This is an independent Data Science project where I will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a brokerage company intending to enter the Kenyan Real Estate market. I am tasked with predicting the prices of real estate property that are up for sale in Kenya. 

For the past two decades, the Kenyan real estate market has experienced significant growth as evidenced by the hundreds of properties that are placed online to be sold for prices up to << Insert Maximum price>>. General prices of real estate property can be influenced by a number of factors such as the number of bedrooms and the property location.

If the company can predict the prices ahead of time, it will be better positioned in the market to help customers answer questions like:
*	Which type of property should I buy or build to maximize my return?
*	Where should I do so?

This will dramatically increase customer confidence in the companyâ€™s offerings and place it above other competitors.
